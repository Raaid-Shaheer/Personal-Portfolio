# Basic HTML Website Project

## Project Overview

This project is a **simple HTML-only website** designed to teach how to structure a website using semantic HTML. The focus of this project is **website structure**, not styling. The website is composed of multiple pages with a consistent navigation bar and includes basic SEO meta tags.

## Pages Included

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)** – Introduction and overview.
2. **Projects (`projects.html`)** – Showcases personal or sample projects.
3. **Articles (`articles.html`)** – Collection of trending frontend development articles.
4. **Contact (`contact.html`)** – Contact details and a form for sending queries.

## Features

* **Semantic HTML structure:**

  * `<header>` for page header
  * `<nav>` for navigation bar
  * `<main>` (recommended) for main content
  * `<footer>` for page footer
* **Navigation bar** linking all pages.
* **Contact form** with `name`, `email`, and `message` fields.
* **SEO meta tags** included in the `<head>` section of each page.
* Ready to be styled later using CSS.

## SEO Meta Tags

* `<meta charset="UTF-8">` – Defines character encoding.
* `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` – Makes the site responsive.
* `<meta name="description">` – Page description for search engines.
* `<meta name="keywords">` – Relevant keywords.
* `<meta name="author">` – Author of the website.

## How to View the Website

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any of the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) in a web browser.
3. Click the navigation links to visit other pages.
4. The contact form can be tested locally using the `GET` method (form data appears in the URL).
